# Configuration (Reference)

This chapter is a lookup reference for environment variables used by commands,
documentation examples, and CI workflows.

```{glossary}
PYTHONPATH
  Python import search path.
  In this project docs, it is used for module execution from source (for example `PYTHONPATH=src uv run -m ...`).

GH_TOKEN
  Token consumed by the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for authenticated API operations.
  Useful for non-interactive runs such as manual workflow dispatch from CI or scripts.

GITHUB_TOKEN
  Ephemeral token automatically injected by GitHub Actions jobs.
  Used by workflows to interact with repository APIs with job-scoped permissions.

NO_COLOR
  De-facto standard variable used by CLI tools to disable ANSI colors.
  Prefer this for plain-text logs where color escape sequences are undesirable.

FORCE_COLOR
  Variable used by many CLIs to force color output even in non-interactive contexts.
  Use only when colorized logs improve readability and your environment strips correctly.
