# Development Workflow (How-to)

This guide covers the most common maintenance tasks.

## Run local QA before pushing

```bash
make qa
make test
```

If `prek` is not installed, install it once with:

```bash
uv tool install prek
```

## Update dependencies safely

This template uses `uv` groups and cooldown windows.
After dependency changes:

```bash
uv sync
make qa
make test
```

## Publish a release

```bash
make bump
make release
```

Release workflows publish package artifacts and canonical docs.

## Preview documentation in pull requests

When docs files change in a PR, CI deploys a preview to:

```text
https://{{ repository_namespace }}.github.io/{{ repository_name }}/_preview/pr-<PR_NUMBER>/
```

If needed, dispatch docs publishing manually:

```bash
gh workflow run cd.yml --ref main
```

`gh` authentication can use {term}`GH_TOKEN`.
